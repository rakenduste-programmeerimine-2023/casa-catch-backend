## EDIT
SO it seems that the districts array has some kind of business logic unknown to me and currently leaving this task as is.

This is the current sample request for Kinnisvara24

```json
{
  "addresses": [
    {
      "A1": "Harju maakond",
      "A2": "Kadriorg",
      "A3": "Harju maakond",
      "A4": "Mustam√§e",
      "A5": "Harju maakond",
      "A6": "Kesklinn"
    }
  ],
  "deal_types": [
    "rent",
    "sale"
  ],
  "from_owner": false,
  "object_types": [
    "apartment"
  ],
  "price_max": 600,
  "price_min": 200,
  "rooms_max": 3,
  "rooms_min": 1,
  "sort_by": "relevance",
  "sort_order": "desc"
}

```
